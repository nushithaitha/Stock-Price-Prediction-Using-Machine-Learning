# 📈 Stock Market Price Prediction Using Machine Learning (ML Project -1)


Arthur Sammuel is the pioneer of Machine Learning, having invented the concept in the 1950s with the first model predicting outcomes in checkers. Machine Learning was initially created to study human cognitive processes.

## 🤖 What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning involves creating models using algorithms and feeding them data so they can learn and make predictions or decisions.

In this project, we are predicting stock prices using historical stock market data.

## 📉 What is the Stock Market?

The stock market is a platform where buying and selling of shares of publicly listed companies occur. The stock exchange acts as a mediator in these transactions. Shares represent ownership in a company.

- **Oldest Stock Exchange**: Amsterdam Stock Exchange, established in 1602.
- **Top Current Stock Exchange**: New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
- **India's Stock Exchanges**: Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), established in the 1800s, the first in Asia, and National Stock Exchange (NSE).

## 🔍 Importance of the Stock Market

- Raises capital for companies.
- Helps individuals create personal wealth.

## 📊 Stock Market Prediction

Stock market prediction involves forecasting the future value of a company's shares to gain profits.

In this project, we use historical data from Tesla and Google to predict stock prices using machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression and LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory models).

### 📈 Linear Regression Algorithm

Linear Regression is a statistical technique for solving supervised learning problems, predicting the output of a continuous target variable.

#### Examples:
- Predicting company revenue.
- Weather prediction.
- Stock price prediction.

The linear regression equation is:
\[ y = mx + c \]
- \( m \) is the slope of the line.
- \( c \) is the intercept.

We will predict Tesla's stock price using approximately 10 years of historical data. The dataset includes:
- **Open**: Price at market open.
- **Close**: Price at market close.
- **High**: Highest price of the day.
- **Low**: Lowest price of the day.
